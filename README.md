# my-projects
I'll be sharing my projects(practice codes) here.
I have been practicing/exploring python for more than a year. Recently, I learned about Tkinter and thought to bhuld a project (GUI) with python & connecting it to MySQL for backened process. It's working is similar to a food ordering application. I have added various features like creating a new account, showing the cart items, placing the coupon code and checkout etc with various prompts like 'the item is already in cart' if a item is already there.
